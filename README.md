# Vibecheque-v2

This is the newer version of my Prime solo project. The biggest differences are that I've switched from an Expo managed workflow to a bare React Native workflow, and I'm implementing a Firebase backend. I'm currently in the process of redoing the entire app to make it more concise and work better with Firebase.
